# GroovyModLoader
GroovyModLoader (GML) is a Forge language loader for Groovy mods.
## How to use
To use this language provider, simply add it as a dependency in your build script. The
language provider is available on ModdingInquisition's maven, so you can simply add the following
to your build script. Make sure to define `gmlVersion` in the `gradle.properties` file, as the version of GML you want to use.
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name = 'Modding Inquisition Releases'
        url = 'https://maven.moddinginquisition.org/releases'
    }
}
dependencies {
    compileOnly "com.matyrobbrt.gml:gml:${gmlVersion}"
    runtimeOnly fg.deobf("com.matyrobbrt.gml:gml:${gmlVersion}:all") {
        exclude module: 'transform'
    }
}
```

Also make sure to add the `groovy` plugin to your build script to ensure that the required
tasks for Groovy compilation are added:
```groovy
plugins {
    id 'groovy'
}
```
In your `mods.toml` / [mods.groovy](https://github.com/GroovyMC/ModsDotGroovy), specify `gml` as the loader and the version of the software
as `loaderVersion`.

The main mod class should have a no-arg constructor and be annotated with `@GMod` with the mod ID specified. Access to the mod and Forge
buses is provided respectively through the `modBus` or `forgeBus` properties.
If you want IDE support alongside `@CompileStatic` for those properties, consider implementing `BaseGMod` in your mod main class or install the [EnhancedGroovy plugin for IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19844-enhancedgroovy).

```groovy
@GMod('examplemod')
@Slf4j(category = 'ExampleMod')
class ExampleMod implements BaseGMod {
    ExampleMod() {
        log.info('Hello from Groovy-land!')
        modBus.register(ModBusEventHandler)
        forgeBus.register(ForgeBusEventHandler)
        assert forgeBus === MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS
        assert modBus === GMLModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus()
    }
}
```

## Groovy Version
The Groovy version provided by the latest version of GML is currently: **${groovyVersion}**.  
To find out what Groovy version a built GML jar provides, you can read the `BundledGroovyVersion` property in the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.

Only releases will be supported by GML, not release candidates.
Once a Forge version has a Recommended Build published, the Groovy major and minor versions will be locked for that Minecraft version. However, patch versions will still be updated.

### Groovy modules
The Groovy modules provided by GML are: ${groovyLibs}.  
You may however include a Groovy module that is **not** provided by GML using [JiJ](https://forge.gemwire.uk/wiki/Jar-in-Jar).  
Please **do not** JiJ different versions of Groovy modules already bundled by GML as that may cause issues.

## MC Versions
The major GML version is bumped every MC version. Below you can find a list of MC version -> GML version:
- `1.19.2` -> `1.x.x`

## Shading GML
While we would appreciate if you instead had a dependency on GML on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gml) in order provide us revenue, we understand that in some cases, you may not
want to depend on another mod. Fortunately, we _are_ JiJ-able.  
If you want to JiJ GML, just follow the guide [here](https://forge.gemwire.uk/wiki/Jar-in-Jar) but replace GSON with the `all` version of GML (the `runtimeOnly` one).
